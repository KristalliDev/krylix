This is a Nuxt 3 project built as a prototype for Real Fake News (RFN) website switching from Next and TSX to Nuxt and Vue.
I have no idea what I'm doing I just want that to be clear.
If you think you can help feel free to submit an issue or pull request!
And as always as per RFN rules, you're welcome =)
